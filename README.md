TO RUN- Replace files sample_male.wav, sample_female.wav in the folder along with pip installation of requirements.txt and run main.wav, make sure you have CUDA support for predict.py else change to 'cpu' and save it. 

TASKS-
Input Signal Simulation - Generated and mixed multi-speaker (Male,Female) audio signals with synthetic or real-world noise (Gaussian Noise) using MATLABâ€™s Audio Toolbox.

Microphone Array Emulation- Simulated microphone arrays using the Phased Array System Toolbox, compute DOA for sound sources. (We have used Male and Female speaker at -20 degrees and 0 degrees respectively, file names - sample_male.wav, sample_female.wav with SNR 20db, and resultant DOA computed are 0 degrees and -20.859 degrees showcasing remarkable accuracy )

Signal Separation- Implemented ICA/BSS and Beamforming techniques to separate audio signals and measure separation quality.(The denoised and Beamformed result .wav files along with DOA are uploaded in the repository)

Noise Reduction- Applied Wiener filtering and spectral subtraction to enhance audio quality. (Denoised audio for male and female are saved in the repository)

Feature Extraction & Classification - Extract MFCCs, pitch features, and classify speakers using custom self-attention based BI-LSTM models after 1-D Convolution of flattened MFCC Values
We have achieved a classification accuracy of 93.5% and F1-Score of 0.89
